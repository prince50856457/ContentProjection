It is mostly used for building desktop applications, web applications, Android apps and enterprise systems.\n\nFeatures of JavaObject-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java supports OOP concepts to create modular and reusable code.\n\nPlatform Independence: Java programs can run on any operating system with a JVM.\n\nRobust and Secure: Java ensures reliability and security through strong memory management and exception handling.\n\nMultithreading and Concurrency: Java allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks for efficiency.\n\nRich API and Standard Libraries: Java provides extensive built-in libraries for various programming needs.\n\nFrameworks for Enterprise and Web Development: Java supports frameworks that simplify enterprise and web application development.\n\nOpen-Source Libraries: Java has a wide range of libraries to extend functionality and speed up development.\n\nMaintainability and Scalability: Java’s structured design allows easy maintenance and growth of applications.\n\nUnderstanding the Hello World Program in Java\n\nWhen we learn any programming language, the first step is writing a simple program to display \"Hello World\". So, here is a simple Java program that displays \"Hello World\" on the screen.\n\nJava\n\n // A Java program to print Hello World!\npublic class HelloWorld {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n }\n}\n\nOutputHello World!\n\nExplanation:\n\nHello World Program ExplanationHow to run the above code?\n\nWrite code in a file like HelloWorld.java.\n\nJava Compiler \"javac\" compiles it into bytecode \"HelloWorld.class\".\n\nJVM (Java Virtual Machine) reads the .class file and interprets the bytecode.\n\nJVM converts bytecode to machine readable code i.e. \"binary\" (001001010) and then execute the program.\n\nJava Program Execution FlowComments in Java\n\nComments are the notes written inside the code to explain what we are doing. The comment lines are not executed while we run the program.\n\nSingle-line comment\n\nJava\n\n // This is a comment\n\nMulti-line comment\n\nJava\n\n /*\nThis is a multi-line comment.\nThis is useful for explaining larger sections of code.\n*/\n\nCurly Braces and Indentation in Java\n\nIn Java, curly braces {} are used to define blocks of code. For example, the body of a class or method is enclosed within curly braces.\n\nExample:\n\nJava\n\n public class Geeks{\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n {\n System.out.println(\"This is inside the block.\");\n }\n\n System.out.println(\"This is outside the block.\");\n }\n}\n\nThe code block inside {} runs unconditionally and prints a message.\n\nCurly braces {} group multiple statements into a single block, even with","keyConcepts":[],"relatedLinks":[{"title":"Java Tutorial","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java/"},{"title":"Advanced Java","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advance-java/advanced-java/"},{"title":"Interview Questions","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-interview-questions/"},{"title":"DSA in Java","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/dsa-in-java/"},{"title":"Java Collection","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-collection-tutorial/"}]}
